Reading: _Macbeth_. Due Session #9

Viewing: [_Fences_](http://www.huntingtontheatre.org/about/history/2009-2010/Fences/) at the Huntington Theater, Boston University Theatre.

Writing: A 3-page analytical paper discussing the performance of _Fences_. You may choose to address a single aspect of the production (acting, directing, lighting, costumes, set) and discuss how the artist created the narrative line through. Or, you may elect to speak about two or three aspects, but you must put them in relation to one another. The thing to avoid is a review! These are critical and analytical essays, and what I will be looking for is how well you observe how the event was _made_ and how well you can analyze and describe it. Cite specifics from the production! Due Session #7

Writing: Discuss this devised play, _Sleep No More_, an interpretation of _Macbeth_. What was important to the company? What was gained; what was lost? Was it still _Macbeth_? Why or why not? If it wasn't _Macbeth_, what was it? As always, cite specifics from the production. 3 pages. Due Session #14

Viewing: _Sin Nombre_, Cary Fukunaga. Due Session #17

Writing: Discuss the acting in both _Sleep No More_ and _Throne of Blood_. Not only are these differing interpretations of _Macbeth_, but they are different media — and styles. You may choose one or two passages to analyze, or a single character, or the specifics of style in each. Address the way the medium shapes the acting. As always cite specific examples. 3 pages.

Guest Lecture: Leslie Held, Costumer.

Costumes; _Macbeth_.


{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}


Costume: Think about one of these three characters: Lady Macbeth, Banquo, Witch 1

The characteristics the class assigned to them are:

Lady M - cunning, ambitious  
Banquo - loyal, honest  
Witch 1 - eccentric, (un)natural

Add your own descriptors to the list, and create a collage representing this character. For inspiration, you may want to refer to work by Kurt Schwitters, Robert Rauschenberg, and Joseph Cornell, but please do not replicate them closely.  
Due Session #16

After we finish the Macbeth presentations, we will have our first conversation about _Waiting for Godot_. Please:

a) bring in 3 salient and specific questions/points about the play  
b) determine what you want to do for your creative project: act, set design, costume design? We will take some time in class to arrange groups if you want, e.g., 2 actors, a set and costume design team.  
c) start to make a written list of "things I have to know" if I am to work on this play.

Writing: Final self-assessment. 3 pages. Due Session #25
